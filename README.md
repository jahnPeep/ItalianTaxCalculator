# ItalianTaxCalculator
My version of a web app that computes the tax code.

In the codFisc repository, we can find all the files needed for running the web application.

We find 3 png, among which ts, nav and nav2, which are part of the design of the page itself, respectively background of the health card, 
navbar1 and navbar2 (based on the media screen).

Then you can see the html index and css stylesheet.

In addition, our folder contains the javascript files which collect all the functions of the page, in this case calculating the tax code.
We find in the foreground func.js that contains the function that takes the input fields entered by the user and returns the tax code;
to do this uses the class created in the main.js or ItalianTaxCalculator and all the functions affiliated.
Lastly, we look at the birthplace.js, which applies to all Italian countries and contains their code and province.
